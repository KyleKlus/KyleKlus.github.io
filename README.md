# My Website

Hi there! You have found the source code for my personal website. This is a statically generated site built with Next.js and hosted via github pages.
It is base on my main website template which you can find [here](https://github.com/KyleKlus/home-page-template).
I am using this template to separate all parts of my website into their own repos, but still keep a cohesive design, by using it. This way I can easily modify the parts and add new ones, without having to worry about breaking the main site.

I use it to host my portfolio and it is the main jumping off point to get to my other projects. So if you like you can click your self through the navigation to see what I have been up to.

## Tools used

- Next.js with App Router
- TypeScript
- Lucide Icons
